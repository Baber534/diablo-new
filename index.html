                    Loot-based RPGs have long been a cornerstone of PC gaming, offering players a satisfying blend of character progression, exploration, and reward-driven gameplay. From early dungeon crawlers to modern open-world experiences, these games have continuously adapted to changing player expectations and technological advancements.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    In the early stages, loot-based RPGs focused primarily on randomized item drops and basic stat upgrades. Players were motivated by the thrill of discovering rare equipment, and progression was often tied to repetitive combat loops.

            </div>

            <div class="article-section">
                <p>
                    Over time, PC platforms allowed developers to experiment with more complex systems, eventually leading to refined experiences seen in modern titles such as 
                    <a href="https://senpaistreaming.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diablo 4 PC</a>, 
                    which represents a more structured and player-centric approach to loot and progression.

            <div class="article-section">
                <p>
                    As hardware capabilities improved, loot mechanics evolved beyond simple rarity tiers. Developers introduced item affixes, skill synergies, and build diversity, transforming loot into a strategic decision-making tool rather than a passive reward.

            </div>

            <div class="article-section">
                <p>
                    Another major evolution came with live updates and seasonal content. Instead of static loot pools, modern PC RPGs refresh item systems regularly, extending replayability and encouraging long-term engagement.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>
                    Community feedback and PC modding cultures have significantly shaped modern loot systems, leading to smarter drop rates, reduced grind fatigue, and more rewarding endgame structures.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-section">
                <p>
                    Modern loot-based RPGs emphasize accessibility and quality-of-life improvements such as inventory management tools, crafting systems, and transparent drop mechanics. These refinements make the genre approachable while preserving depth for experienced players.

                    Looking ahead, loot-based RPGs on PC are likely to continue evolving through adaptive systems, AI-driven balancing, and deeper narrative integration. Loot has become a defining element of player identity and long-term progression.
